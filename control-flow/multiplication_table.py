# The code above is a simple multiplication table generator.
# It prompts the user to enter a number and then prints the multiplication table for that number from 1 to 10.
# The code uses a for loop to iterate through the numbers 1 to 10 and calculates the product of the input number and the current loop index.
# The result is printed in a formatted string.
# The code is straightforward and does not require any complex logic or error handling.
